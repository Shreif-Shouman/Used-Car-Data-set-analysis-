# Visual Analytics of Used Car Prices ðŸš—

## Project Overview ðŸŒŸ
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of used car prices across various models and manufacturers. By exploring relationships between car features such as mileage, engine size, year, and price, we aim to uncover trends and insights that could assist buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Dataset Description ðŸ“š
The dataset comprises about 100,000 listings of used cars, categorized by the car manufacturer. Each file corresponds to a specific car model and includes features like price, mileage, engine size, and more. The data is rich in both numerical and categorical types, making it ideal for visual analytics.

## Installation and Setup ðŸ”§
Clone this repository and install the required Python packages to replicate the analysis:

## Key Insights ðŸ’¡
* Price Distribution: Analyze how car prices are distributed and what factors most significantly affect the price.
* Popularity by Model: Discover which models are most popular in the used car market.
* Sales Distribution Over Years: Explore how car sales trends have changed over recent years.
  
## Visualizations ðŸ“Š
Our analysis includes several key visualizations:
* Histograms: Show the distribution of car prices.
* Scatter Plots: Illustrate the relationship between mileage and price.
* Bar Charts: Highlight the most popular car models.

## Advanced Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
We delve deeper with techniques like PCA and t-SNE to explore data dimensionality reduction:

* PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Attempts to capture the essence of data by reducing dimensions.
* t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Used for visualizing high-dimensional data.
